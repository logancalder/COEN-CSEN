// Worst-Case Runtime & Explanation For App1

createSet O(1)
addElement O(n)
search O(n)
removeAge O(n)
maxAgeGap O(n)
destroySet O(1)

I chose a 2D array for this application given that memory efficiency was not being
considered for this assignment, but rather runtime. Given that a 2D array and hash
chaining would have the same worst-case runtime, I chose a 2D array as I believed it
to be more simple to implement.

This was a good choice (compared to, say, a hash table or tree) as we are searching
by age (which is not unique to a student). Due to this, many results will be found.
Regardless of our implementation, it will still take O(n) iterations to find and 
perform an operation on every student of an age, which permits the usage of hash
chaining or a 2D array. Using sequential search, I accomplish this task.
