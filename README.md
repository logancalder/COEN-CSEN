# COEN - ELEN Coursework Repository
#### This is a repository containing all my relevant coursework and labwork at SCU for COEN & ELEN. Not all of these submissions are 100% accurate, but overall contain an average score >95% and display an example of what I am able to create utilizing the languages studied at SCU.

------------


### COEN (CSEN)
#### Computer Science courses, where work is mainly programming in C, C++, or ARM Assembly.
### ELEN (ELEC)
#### Electrical Engineering courses, where work is a mix of programming (Matlab or Python), and physical engineering.

------------


#### IMPORTANT: Not all work was 100% created by me. A good portion of these scripts were either provided to me & supplemented or done with a group. Submissions that CONTAIN my own work show my name at the top, but may not fully be my own.
